    "Elastic Net Regression is a regularized regression method that combines the L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties. This combination allows it to handle multicollinearity, reduce overfitting, and select relevant features. Unlike Lasso, which only shrinks coefficients and sets some to zero, and Ridge, which only shrinks coefficients without setting them to zero, Elastic Net adapts to different situations and data sets by using a linear combination of both penalties.\r\n",
