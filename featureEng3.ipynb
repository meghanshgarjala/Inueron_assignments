    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting categorical data into numerical format so that machine learning algorithms can interpret and process it. This transformation is crucial because most machine learning models require numerical input. Encoding ensures that categorical variables can be included in models effectively, preserving the underlying information and relationships."
