    "Ridge Regression is a type of linear regression that assigns more importance to the observed values and less to the coefficients themselves. This is achieved by adding a penalty term to the cost function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients (L2 regularization). In contrast, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression minimizes the sum of squared errors without any penalty.\r\n",
